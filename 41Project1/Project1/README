Other Comments
    There are comments explaining the use of every cpp and how they come together to work in the menu

    NOTE: This program might not take the inputs from the user very nicely and will either loop infinitly or show a blank screen. If so please rerun the program.
    NOTE: Highly Recommend to run through the menu.exe as my IDE terminal and others don't behave well with the program
